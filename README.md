# Robothon: A series of workshops, and a competition

## What is Robothon?

**Robothon** by **Electronix ENSTABC** is a 24h long event held within the walls of [**ENSTA Borj Cedria**](http://www.enstab.rnu.tn/) as a fast-paced introduction to the world of robotics. 

During **Robothon**, the attendees go through a series of workshops (4-5) that cover all aspects of robotics, in a hands-on manner, and to make all what they learned stick, a competition between all attending teams is held for the last 5-6 hours of the event so that they can experience real life **collaborative problem-solving** when working towards a set goal.

**Robothon** in bullet points:
- Registration opens and individuals book their places
- Teams are formed by the organizing team (randomly split)
- The day of the event, teams get their components that they'll use all along the event, and go through the workshops together
- After the last workshop, the specifications doc is presented to them, and the competition starts, and continues for the next 5-6 hours
- As the competition ends, all teams compete with their robots 
- We now have another successful **Robothon**.

### Note

The content of this repo doesn't belong to me([Rad-hi](https://github.com/Rad-hi)) only, instead it's a cumulative effort by the good people of **Electronix ENSTABC**, who wanted an effective and efficient way to deliver knowledge, each year, to the new-comers of our school.

## First step

The first step in your journey with robotics is to install the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide)(Integrated Development Environment) which is the **FREE & open-source** tool that we'll use to create all kinds of impressive and cool stuff (mainly robots).

### So let's get you started!

Go to this website [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), and download the **Arduino IDE**.

Congrats! now you're all ready to tackle robothon's workshops!

## Workshop1 folder

The first hands-on workshop is meant to be an introduction to the Arduino development environment, Arduino community, Arduino [microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller), and Arduino's place in the embedded world.

The hello world for the embedded systems field is the **Blink** project, this is the first time you'll be controlling a physical LED with code. Once you go through it, you're an embedded engineer, or at least, a little step closer to becoming one! 

(Well, what you did is huge! In fact, you wrote text on a computer that understood what you meant with that text and translated it into a bunch of instructions, which when run inside the other smaller computer (Arduino), will control it in a way that it(Arduino) would understand and control electrical signals in a way that would allow electrons to run through a [PN junction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction)(LED) that's light emitting in nature, and result in you seeing visible light, and all this is being precisely timed ... see how fascinating what you just did was!?)
